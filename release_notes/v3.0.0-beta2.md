## What's New in beta2

This release focuses on **SteamOS reliability** - specifically solving the long-standing issue of build environment persistence across SteamOS updates.

### Homebrew-Based Build Environment (SteamOS)

**The Problem:** SteamOS uses a read-only A/B partition filesystem. Packages installed via `pacman` are wiped on every system update, forcing users to rebuild their development environment repeatedly.

**The Solution:** beta2 now uses [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) for the build toolchain on SteamOS:

| Aspect | Old (pacman) | New (Homebrew) |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| Install location | `/usr` (wiped on updates) | `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew` (**persists!**) |
| First-time setup | ~5 min (when it worked) | ~10 min |
| After SteamOS update | Full reinstall needed | **Instant** (already there) |
| Reliability | Broken on SteamOS 3.5+ | Works reliably |

**Benefits:**
- Build environment survives all SteamOS updates
- No need to fight the read-only filesystem
- Self-contained GCC toolchain (no system dependencies)
- Same approach works on other immutable distros

### Installer Improvements

- **Complete Refactor**: Installer rewritten for clarity and maintainability
- **System-Level Bootstrap Timer**: Self-healing mechanism moved from user-level to system-level for proper privilege escalation
- **tmpfiles.d Persistence**: Uses tmpfiles.d (not just bootstrap timer) to restore symlinks on every boot - survives SteamOS updates
- **Versioned GCC Detection**: Properly finds Homebrew's `gcc-15`/`g++-15` binaries
- **CC Symlinks**: Creates `cc`/`c++` symlinks for Rust's cc crate compatibility
- **Environment Passthrough**: CC/CXX variables properly passed through sudo for cargo builds
- **Pre-Release Warning**: Clear disclaimer that this is testing software

### CAKE QoS Fixes

- **Bandwidth No Longer Stuck at 50Mbit**: Removed throughput-based bandwidth capping that caused a chicken-and-egg problem during speed tests
- **PHY Rate Direct**: Now uses WiFi PHY rate directly for CAKE bandwidth (driver/AP negotiate best rate based on signal quality)

## Installation

### Fresh Install
```bash
git clone -b testing https://github.com/doughty247/hifi-wifi.git
cd hifi-wifi
sudo ./install.sh
```

### Upgrade from beta1
```bash
cd ~/hifi-wifi
git fetch origin
git checkout testing
git pull
sudo ./install.sh
```

## Testing Checklist

Please verify and report results:

1. **Install**: Does installer complete without errors?
2. **Homebrew** (SteamOS): Does `brew --version` work after install?
3. **Persistence**: Does the service survive a reboot?
4. **SteamOS Update**: After a SteamOS update, does `sudo ./install.sh` skip Homebrew setup?
5. **Gaming**: While gaming, does `hifi-wifi status` show stable bandwidth?

**Report Issues:**
```bash
{ hifi-wifi status; journalctl -u hifi-wifi -n 100; } > report.txt
```
Attach `report.txt` to a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/doughty247/hifi-wifi/issues).

## Known Issues

- **GCC Post-Install Warning**: Homebrew may show "post-install step did not complete successfully" - this is harmless and gcc works fine
- **First Build Time**: Initial Homebrew + GCC download takes ~10 minutes on SteamOS
