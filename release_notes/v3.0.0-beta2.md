## What's New in beta2

This release delivers **two major reliability fixes** that address long-standing issues reported by users:

### Issue #10 Fix: The Reconnection Problem

**The Problem:** Users discovered that manual WiFi reconnection fixed stutters, even when CAKE was active and power save was off. The "optimization" wasn't from hifi-wifi - it was from the reconnection itself clearing stale driver state.

**Root Cause:** The v3.x Rust daemon polls every 2 seconds but doesn't know when WiFi reconnects. After sleep/roaming/reconnection, it continued using cached bitrates from before the event, leading to incorrect CAKE bandwidth settings.

**The Fix:** Hybrid event-driven architecture (inspired by v1.x dispatcher approach):
- NetworkManager dispatcher script at `/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-hifi-wifi-connect`
- Triggers on connection up, touches `/run/hifi-wifi/connection-changed`
- Daemon watches file with inotify (via `notify` crate)
- On connection event: clears bitrate cache → waits 1s for link stability → re-optimizes with fresh readings

**Result:** Stutters no longer require manual reconnection. The daemon automatically detects connection state changes and applies fresh optimizations.

### Smart Band Steering Improvements

Enhanced the 2.4GHz ↔ 5GHz roaming algorithm for better gaming performance:

**Throughput-Aware Scoring:**
- Old: Score = RSSI + band_bias (pure signal strength)
- New: Score = RSSI + band_bias + throughput_bonus (considers actual link capacity)
- Throughput bonus: 5% of max_bitrate, capped at +12 dBm equivalent
- Prevents roaming to "stronger" AP with worse actual throughput

**6GHz Support:**
- Added 6GHz band detection and scoring
- 6GHz bias: +20 dBm (favors 6GHz over congested 2.4/5GHz)
- Minimum signal threshold: -68 dBm

**Per-Band Signal Thresholds:**
- 2.4GHz: -72 dBm minimum (more lenient due to better range)
- 5GHz: -75 dBm minimum (aggressive - favor 5GHz when viable)
- 6GHz: -68 dBm minimum (requires good signal due to higher frequency)

**Increased 5GHz Preference:**
- 5GHz bias increased from +15 dBm → +20 dBm
- Matches 6GHz bias to strongly favor higher bands for gaming

**Cache Clearing on Roam:**
- When band steering triggers a roam, clears `last_good_bitrate` cache
- Ensures CAKE bandwidth recalculated with fresh bitrate after roaming

### SteamOS Reliability - Homebrew Build Environment

**The Problem:** SteamOS uses a read-only A/B partition filesystem. Packages installed via `pacman` are wiped on every system update, forcing users to rebuild their development environment repeatedly.

**The Solution:** beta2 now uses [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) for the build toolchain on SteamOS:

| Aspect | Old (pacman) | New (Homebrew) |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| Install location | `/usr` (wiped on updates) | `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew` (**persists!**) |
| First-time setup | ~5 min (when it worked) | ~10 min |
| After SteamOS update | Full reinstall needed | **Instant** (already there) |
| Reliability | Broken on SteamOS 3.5+ | Works reliably |

**Benefits:**
- Build environment survives all SteamOS updates
- No need to fight the read-only filesystem
- Self-contained GCC toolchain (no system dependencies)
- Same approach works on other immutable distros

### Installer Improvements

- **Complete Refactor**: Installer rewritten for clarity and maintainability
- **Versioned GCC Detection**: Properly finds Homebrew's `gcc-15`/`g++-15` binaries
- **CC Symlinks**: Creates `cc`/`c++` symlinks for Rust's cc crate compatibility
- **Environment Passthrough**: CC/CXX variables properly passed through sudo for cargo builds
- **Pre-Release Warning**: Clear disclaimer that this is testing software

### SteamOS Persistence - The Native Linux Way

**The Problem:** SteamOS wipes `/etc` and `/usr` on every update. Previous approaches tried to fight this:
- tmpfiles.d configs - wiped (lives in /etc)
- System timers with symlinks - wiped  
- Systemd presets - wiped
- Self-repairing symlinks - fragile and dangerous (`steamos-readonly disable`)

**The Solution:** Stop fighting `/usr` - use `$PATH` instead!

| Component | Location | Survives Update? |
|-----------|----------|------------------|
| Binary | `/var/lib/hifi-wifi/hifi-wifi` | YES (`/var` persists) |
| CLI access | `~/.bashrc` PATH entry | YES (`/home` persists) |
| User repair service | `~/.config/systemd/user/` | YES (`/home` persists) |
| System service | `/etc/systemd/system/` | NO (repaired on boot) |
| Polkit rule | `/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/` | NO (repaired on boot) |
| **NM Dispatcher** | `/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/` | NO (repaired on boot) |

**How it works:**
1. Installer adds `/var/lib/hifi-wifi` to your `$PATH` in `~/.bashrc`
2. CLI command `hifi-wifi` works because it's in your PATH (no symlinks!)
3. User systemd service runs at boot (via `loginctl enable-linger`)
4. Repair script recreates systemd service file if missing
5. **SteamOS updates become irrelevant** - nothing in `/usr` to wipe!

**Why this is better:**
- No `steamos-readonly disable/enable` cycles
- No fragile symlink self-repair logic
- Works with Game Mode (lingering enabled)
- Standard Linux approach - works on ANY immutable distro

### CAKE QoS Fixes

- **Bandwidth No Longer Stuck at 50Mbit**: Removed throughput-based bandwidth capping that caused a chicken-and-egg problem during speed tests
- **PHY Rate Direct**: Now uses WiFi PHY rate directly for CAKE bandwidth (driver/AP negotiate best rate based on signal quality)

## Testing Checklist

Please verify and report results:

1. **Install**: Does installer complete without errors?
2. **Homebrew** (SteamOS): Does `brew --version` work after install?
3. **CLI Access**: After opening a new terminal, does `hifi-wifi status` work?
4. **Persistence**: Does the service survive a reboot?
5. **Connection Events**: Disconnect and reconnect WiFi - does `journalctl -u hifi-wifi -f` show cache clearing and re-optimization?
6. **Band Steering**: If you have dual-band WiFi (2.4GHz + 5GHz with same SSID), does it roam to the better band?
7. **SteamOS Update**: After a SteamOS update:
   - Does `hifi-wifi status` still work? (should - PATH is in ~/.bashrc)
   - Does the service auto-repair on login?
   - Is the NetworkManager dispatcher still present?
8. **Game Mode**: Boot directly into Game Mode - does service start?

**Report Issues:**
```bash
{ hifi-wifi status; journalctl -u hifi-wifi -n 100; } > report.txt
```
Attach `report.txt` to a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/doughty247/hifi-wifi/issues).

## Known Issues

- **GCC Post-Install Warning**: Homebrew may show "post-install step did not complete successfully" - this is harmless and gcc works fine
- **First Build Time**: Initial Homebrew + GCC download takes ~10 minutes on SteamOS
- **New Terminal Required**: After install, open a new terminal for `hifi-wifi` command (PATH needs to reload)

---

|---------|-------------|
| `hifi-wifi status` | Show optimization state & statistics |
| `sudo hifi-wifi monitor` | Run daemon with live logs |
| `sudo hifi-wifi apply` | Apply optimizations once |
| `sudo hifi-wifi on/off` | Start/Stop service |
