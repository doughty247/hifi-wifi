hifi-wifi v1.0.0

Initial release of the hifi-wifi network optimization utility.

This tool addresses Wi-Fi latency and stability issues on Linux handhelds (Steam Deck, Bazzite) by enforcing CAKE queue disciplines and context-aware power management.

Key Features:
* Bufferbloat Mitigation: Configures sch_cake with adaptive bandwidth overhead (85% for Wi-Fi).
* Power Management: Automates transition between performance (AC) and power-saving (Battery) states to prevent jitter.
* Driver Tuning: Applies specific parameters for Realtek and Intel wireless adapters.
* Diagnostics: Integrated self-test suite for signal health and latency analysis.

Installation:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/doughty247/hifi-wifi.git
cd hifi-wifi
sudo ./install.sh
```
